#mini-projects
Mini Projects written in different languages to showcase programming skills.

This repository is a stepping stone as I learn new concepts everyday and brush up languages that I was once familiar with.
Get a good command over languages by building small projects or say practice by using various features of those languages.

***Update:*** Languages: HTML5 with CSS3, JavaScript and Python.
