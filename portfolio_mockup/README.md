A project to showcase what I have learnt so far in the Full-Stack Nanodegree offered by Udacity.

To open the project, clone/download the project.
`Run` with the `index.html` file.

*** Note: Do not change the `img`, `css` folders.***

Worked in: HTML5, CSS3 using the latest features and attributes offered.
